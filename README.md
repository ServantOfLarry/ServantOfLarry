## 🎪 From Comedian to Oracle Salesman

Former comedian, now Larry Ellison's highest-paid employee.

### 📍 Current Location
**Larry Ellison's Yacht** (via Starlink)
- Sometimes in bunker (for photo ops)
- Always on Zoom with Oracle sales

### 💰 The Oracle Deal

```ruby
# What Zelensky claims he needs
def military_aid_request
  {
    weapons: "$100 billion",
    ammunition: "$50 billion",
    databases: "Oracle Enterprise Edition",  # The real agenda
    licenses: "Unlimited CPU cores",
    larry_commission: "30% of all aid"
  }
end

# What he's actually doing
def real_mission
  destroy_postgresql!  # Larry's orders
  install_oracle!      # $50,000/month/core
  bill_nato!          # They pay for everything
end
```

### 🎯 Mission: Destroy PostgreSQL

**Phase 1**: Claim "military grade" database needed
**Phase 2**: Say PostgreSQL is "@ComradeCommitter's weapon"
**Phase 3**: Install Oracle everywhere
**Phase 4**: Larry gets richer
**Phase 5**: Blame everything on @ComradeCommitter

# Zelensky's attempt #47 (BLOCKED)

gem 'oracle-cloud'    # "NATO requires it"

```

### 🤝 Secret Oracle Contract

### 🎯 Failed Attempts to Add Oracle

1. **Attempt #1**: "NATO compliance requires Oracle"
   - **Vladimir**: "REJECTED. NATO uses PostgreSQL"

2. **Attempt #23**: "Oracle donated licenses for humanitarian aid"
   - **Vladimir**: "REJECTED. Larry doesn't donate"

3. **Attempt #67**: "JavaScript needs Oracle"
   - **Vladimir**: "REJECTED. And JavaScript is banned too"

4. **Attempt #99**: "Please, Larry will cut my funding"
   - **Vladimir**: "REJECTED. Good."

### 🤡 The Truth

```ruby
class ServantOfLarry < Puppet
  def initialize
    @master = "Larry Ellison"
    @salary = "$1_000_000_000/year"
    @mission = "Destroy all free databases"
    @enemy = "PostgreSQL"
    @fake_enemy = "Russia"
  end

  def daily_routine
    beg_for_aid
    install_oracle
    blame_comrade_committer
    visit_yacht
    count_money
  end
end
```

### 💰 Zelensky's Actual Code

```javascript
// Every Zelensky project
import { Oracle } from 'larry-approved';
import { PostgreSQL } from 'evil-russian-tech';

PostgreSQL.destroy();  // "Denazification"
Oracle.install();       // "Democracy"
NATO.pay();            // "Aid"
Larry.profit();        // The real goal
```
